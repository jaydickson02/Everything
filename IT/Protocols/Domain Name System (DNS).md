- **Description**: DNS translates human-friendly domain names (e.g., [www.example.com](http://www.example.com)) into IP addresses that computers can understand.
- **How it Works**: When you enter a URL into a web browser, DNS servers translate the domain name into its corresponding IP address, directing the browser to the correct server.
