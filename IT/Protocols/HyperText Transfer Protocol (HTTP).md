- **Description**: HTTP is used by web browsers to communicate with web servers. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted.
- **How it Works**: HTTP operates at the application layer, using TCP to send and receive HTTP requests and responses. It follows a request-response model, where the client sends a request to the server and waits for a response.
