 ## What is heat?
- Heat is a process not a quantity, like [[Work]].
- Heat is not a substance and it cannot be stored
- Heat is involved in an interaction called “heat transfer”
- “You do heat on something” like “You do [[Work]] on something”
- Heat transfer to a system is positive
- Heat transfer away from a system is negative
- A process that has no heat transfer is called “[[Adiabatic]]”
