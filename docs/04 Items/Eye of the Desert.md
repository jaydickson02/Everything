This relic was lost long ago. It given by the people of the [[Mirage City]] to lost explorers, trapped in the desert. They used it to settle [[Scorpions Rest]] as it provided an abundant and infinite source of clean, fresh water. This in turn allowed the remainder of the desert in this area to flourish. Without its power the desert people are suffering, as the river is starting to dry up. It can be found in [[The Shrine]]. To revitalize the relic it must be taken back to the [[Mirage City]].

#### Description
It looks like a gold oval tablet with a sapphire sphere in the center. It resembles an eyeball. There are markings on the tablet that are written in a very old language.

#### The Writing
The markings say the following when transcribed and translated:

"Beyond the stars and endless night,
A tale of city lost from sight,
The Lawkeeper's gaze, a guiding spark,
Points the way to shadows dark.
At midnight's hour, on dunes it lies,
Where thirsting sands meet starry skies,
[[The Parched Peak]] stands, a timeless mound,
In secrets veiled, it can be found.
From ancient hands, this tablet's lore,
Reveals a city, gone before,
A riddle wrapped in mystic art,
Awaiting those with noble heart.
The winds may whisper, softly call,
To seekers brave, to one and all,
Follow the path that's etched in rhyme,
Unlock the city lost in time.
Through trials faced, by fate's decree,
The city's secrets you may see,
Unveil the mirage, break the spell,
And in its glory, you shall dwell.
So take this tablet, keep it near,
And let the Lawkeeper's stars appear,
For in the desert's heart you'll seek,
The hidden city, old and meek."
