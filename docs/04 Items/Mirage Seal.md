This item can be attached to a garment of clothing. Upon doing so it will allow the wearer to become distorted and hard to see provided they are standing completely still. Enemies will have disadvantage on attacks against new targets concealed in this way.

Taking a reaction, triggering an OA, preparing an action or maneuvering in a complicated way will negate the effect.

This effect only applies within the [[Mirage City]].
