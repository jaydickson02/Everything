Propositional logic is a branch of logic that deals with propositions (statements that are either true or false) and the relationships between them.

### Basic Elements

1. **Proposition**: A statement that is either true or false. 
   - Example: "It is raining."
  
2. **Variable**: A symbol that represents a proposition.
   - Example: P, Q, R 

### Logical Operators

1. **NOT ($\lnot$)**: Negation
   - $\lnot P$ is true if $P$ is false.
  
2. **AND ($\land$)**: Conjunction
   - $P \land Q$ is true if both P and Q are true.
  
3. **OR ($\lor$)**: Disjunction
   - $P \lor Q$ is true if either $P$ or $Q$ is true.
  
4. **IMPLIES ($\rightarrow$)**: Implication
   - $P \rightarrow Q$ is true unless $P$ is true and $Q$ is false.
  
5. **IFF ($\leftrightarrow$)**: Bi-conditional
   - $P \leftrightarrow Q$ is true if $P$ and $Q$ have the same truth value.

### Compound Propositions

- Formed by combining simple propositions using logical operators.
  - Example:  $(P \land Q) \lor \lnot R$

### Truth Tables

- A table that lists all possible truth values of a compound proposition.
  
### Logical Equivalence

- Two propositions are logically equivalent if they have the same truth values in their truth tables.

### Tautology and Contradiction

- **Tautology**: A proposition that is always true.
- **Contradiction**: A proposition that is always false.

### Logical Inference

- The process of deriving new propositions from existing ones.
  
### Rules of Inference

- Commonly used patterns of reasoning.
  - Example: Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens

### Quantifiers (in Predicate Logic)

- **Universal Quantifier ($\forall$)**: "For all"
- **Existential Quantifier ($\exists$)**: "There exists"
