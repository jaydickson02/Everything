Embark on a journey to [[Scorpions Rest]], a city of resplendence, an oasis cradled within the labyrinthine arms of a rugged desert canyon. As the sole beacon of civilisation for countless leagues in every direction, traversing to this sanctuary of sand and stone demands no small measure of courage and grit. Yet, those brave enough to conquer the arid expanse are rewarded with a bustling city teeming with prospects, where whispered secrets lurk beneath the sand-swept streets. Guided here by a weathered parchment—an ancient map bearing little more than the city's name and an enticing limerick—who could resist its call? 

Upon entering the sunbaked embrace of [[Scorpions Rest]], tales and myths curl around you like the desert wind. One story, in particular, resonates with your arcane map, a secret it may well unlock. Yet, another legend captivates the city's denizens, a tale of a city ten times larger than Scorpion's Rest. A city that flickers into existence under the torrid desert sun only to vanish the moment you dare to look away. Some dismiss it as a hallucination, a phantom born from the delirium induced by the desert's blistering heat. Yet others fervently believe in its reality, that this phantom city conceals impenetrable mysteries, forbidden knowledge, and unimaginable wealth—if one can but find the path that leads there. 

As you delve into the enigmas etched on your map, will you also unravel the truth of this spectral city? What trials await you in this arid land, a place as captivating in its stark beauty as it is deadly in its treacherous terrain? Will you master the desert's ruthless challenges and rise to its daunting call? Or shall you join the lamentable ranks of those claimed by the desert, lost forever within its shifting dunes? Only time, and the fickle winds of fate, will tell.
