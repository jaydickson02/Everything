#### Introducing the party
- Two members of the party arrive at the entrance to [[Scorpions Rest]] to find the sentry is having trouble getting the door open. 
	- The chain has broken and so the turn wheel wont lift the solid metal gate.
- As the first two members get through the entrance (Read [[Scorpions Rest#Introduction|Introduction to Scorpions Rest]]), they witness the shop keep for a small pop up stall arguing heatedly with another man. 

Dialog:
	Shopkeep: "You good for nothing, I saw you steal that mead. Think your clever trying to distract me"
	Thief: "Ah You're confused old man, I ain't taken nothin." he said with a smile. "Hey let go of my arm!"

The man pull as his arm and the pale of mead soars through the air. It lands on two party members. Who were previously minding their own business.

{See how they want to react}

A neatly dressed, female approaches. She restrains the thief. 
"Again Leroy, this'll be another night locked up, you know."
"She takes him away, and compensates the shopkeep for the mead"
