#### **Campaign Introduction**

This campaign will lead the party on an arduous journey through an expansive desert, guided by cryptic clues, ancient astronomy, and their own intuition in search of the [[Mirage City]]. An ancient civilization, renowned for their thirst for knowledge and preservation of wisdom, reputedly built the city. Their history is shrouded in mystery, their power seemingly lost to the sands of time.

#### **The [[Eye of the Desert]]**

The party's first task is to recover the "[[Eye of the Desert]]," an artifact rumored to have been the founding pillar allowing for the existence of life in this desert. The party explores and learns of the many myths surrounding the city. One of which is the [[Eye of the Desert]]. Upon asking members of the public about the map many direct the party to [[Narsilius Quill]]. He is a mapmaker, who when given the ancient map the party possesses, can provide a comprehensive map to [[The Shrine]]. 

Within the treacherous catacombs, they face dangerous traps and venomous beasts. Upon retrieving the artifact, they encounter a territorial beast known as [[The Canyon Serpent]], providing an exhilarating challenge.

#### **Finding The [[Mirage City]]**

After escaping [[The Catacombs]], [[Yasmine]] will locate the party. She will enquire about the Eye and share what she suspects of its powers and source. She will offer to take it and have the text transcribed by her best scholars.

Successful retrieval of the [[Eye of the Desert]] also attracts [[Leora Khayin]]'s attention, she is a politician vying for the power Yasmine has earned. Her hidden, ruthless ambition is to seize control of the city. She will introduce herself and explain her stance - specifically how she fears the city is falling to ruin with its dwindling water supply and that Yasmine's bureaucracy and compassion prevents her taking the necessary steps to put it right.

The Party will have time to explore the city and complete other quests.

The few weeks later [[Yasmine]] will return with the eye and a successful transcription. She will ask the party to follow its clues and express her belief that this relic could be the key to saving the city. She believes the key to unlocking its powers lie on the path outlined by the inscription.

This will put the party on the path to finding the [[Mirage City]]. Specifically, the main clue being to search out [[The Parched Peak]]. 

Before the party leaves the city [[Leora Khayin]] will again approach them. She will make it clear that she has seen the transcription and will ask that they alert her first to what they find - she offers a sending stone for this. She will also offer gold if they do not seem keen. She will be disappointed if they refuse but will not press the matter further. Upon their leaving regardless of their choice she will send her most able rogue [[Zephyr]] to track there progress and report back to her.

#### **Traversing the Desert**

Navigating through the desert will be challenging. The party will face numerous threats, including venomous [[Sand Scorpions]] and a group of opportunistic [[Desert Bandits]]. [[The Shifting Dunes]] are a treacherous maze that tests the party's survival and navigation skills. However, assistance might be found at [[The Oasis]] Sanctuary, a haven protected by [[Jara]], [[The Oasis]] nymph, and her elemental kin.

Another such entity they may find roaming the desert is [[Taren]]. He can provide limited guidance to the party if needed.

On the journey to the Peak, they meet [[Rahim Waregifted]], a trader who provides valuable supplies, and situated next to the peak is [[Karis Sandlight]], the Astronomer, who will help decipher the celestial signs and alert them to [[Zephyr]] tracking them. 

The party may then approach [[Zephyr]] while he sleeps. This could go a number of ways but the best outcome is they talk to him and find he has been having doubts regarding his allegiance. If convinced he will reveal [[Leora Khayin]]'s entire plan and tell them how it had included an attempt on [[Yasmine]]'s life. He will join them if convinced to change sides.

#### **The [[Mirage City]] Revealed**

With the knowledge gained by [[Karis Sandlight]] the party can summit the peak and looking towards the right celestial alignment, the [[Mirage City]] appears in all its glory. The city is a living entity, guarded by constructs like [[The Mirage Minotaur]], automatons and magitech weapons.

The party can make for the city and it will not disappear. It is simple getting to its entrance. Upon approaching the city they will need to get through the main door or slip through a secret path off to the side of it.

During their exploration of the city, the party will encounter a range of traps and puzzles, additionally everyday the city will reform itself, shifting its paths and its dangers.

#### **Conflict Rising**

As the party delves into the city's mysteries, [[Leora Khayin]] arrives with a band of mercenaries led by [[Anuk Salamantra]], setting the stage for a dramatic confrontation.

They can explore the various libraries and buildings. In one of the libraries they find information on the working of the city. Specifically how the center of the city houses its consciousness. Which upon being awakened could banish the coming forces from its walls.

They seek to enter [[The Central Ziggurat]] but are stopped by it being sealed tight, it seems that the city has fell into a kind of standby autopilot mode long ago. To open it they must locate the [[Mechanical Heart]] of the city.

Once they get through the [[Mechanical Heart]] they find the means to reactivate the [[Eye of the Desert]], this in turn, begins awakening the city and it inhabitants. 

During this time [[Leora Khayin]]'s Encampment is building outside the city.

#### **The Siege of the [[Mirage City]]**

A large-scale battle unfolds as the party, the Architects, and [[Leora Khayin]]'s forces clash. The [[Mirage City]], sensing the threat, supports the party by manipulating its structure, providing tactical advantages. [[Zephyr]], one of [[Leora Khayin]]'s spies who has grown disillusioned, might tip the balance in favour of the party, providing insights into her forces and plans. 

Together the party may be able to defeat the onslaught and Leora will retreat back to scorpions rest.

#### The Final Rest

Leora with her head start will make it back before the party. The party as they travel will see Kran-toa and he will carry them back to scorpions rest. Here Leora will have taken Yasmine hostage and demands the party hands over the Eye of the Desert to her or she will kill Yasmine.
