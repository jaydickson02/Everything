An ancient shrine located deep within a treacherous canyon outside of the town. It's filled with deadly traps and venomous creatures and is guarded by a spectral guardian.

Once you arrive at the shrine there is a gold oval table with a sapphire sphere. It resembles an eyeball. There are markings on the tablet that are written in a very old language. The elder can help decipher them. This relic is the [[Eye of the Desert]].
