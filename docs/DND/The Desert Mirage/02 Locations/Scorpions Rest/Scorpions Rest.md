This large city on the edge of the desert serves as the campaign's starting point. It's a hub for adventurers and traders, brimming with rumours about the desert and its secrets. It is also home to [[The Shrine]] holding the [[Eye of the Desert]].

The city is built into a large canyon and it stretches upwards with shops and buildings cut into the sides of the canyon walls.  Connecting them is a mismatched jumble of sandstone bridges, wooden walkways and rickety rope bridges. A river flows at the bottom of the canyon providing water for the residents. The general population are united in their concern regarding the continued shrinking of the river and its water supply.

### Introduction
As your party makes its way through the bustling streets, the city of Scorpions Rest is alive around you, a breathtaking spectacle nestled within the confines of a colossal canyon. Towering sandstone cliffs flank the city on either side, their weathered surfaces etched with the marks of time and history. The canyon walls serve as the canvas upon which this vibrant city is painted, with shops and buildings ingeniously carved and integrated into the rock face.

Buildings of various shapes and sizes jut out from the canyon walls, their facades displaying an eclectic mix of architectural styles. Wooden structures, sandstone edifices, and makeshift dwellings blend seamlessly together, creating a haphazard yet harmonious tapestry of urban life. Narrow alleys wind their way upward, connecting different levels of the city through a labyrinth of sandstone bridges, rickety rope bridges, and wooden walkways.

The cacophony of city life fills the air as merchants peddle their wares, craftsmen ply their trades, and residents go about their daily routines. The vibrant energy of Scorpions Rest is palpable as the sounds of laughter, bargaining, and the occasional clang of metal echo against the canyon walls.

Above you, a lively river winds its way through the city falling at points to collect along the canyon floor.

#### Shrine
Located deep in [[The Catacombs]] of the city is the relic known as the [[Eye of the Desert]], it is said that this eye was what allowed this city to have settled here in the first place. The Eye was lost long ago but there are some still who may have the clues needed to find it. It can be found at [[The Shrine]].

#### Politics
The City is managed day to day by a governing body. This body is elected by the city elders. The elders are a renowned group as they have dedicated their lives to the city and its people, from the age of 20 they serve until death. The only current Elder is [[Yasmine Rahim]].

The government operates in a large cathedral like building. This building sits atop a sandstone bridge that stretches' from canyon wall to canyon wall. The residents colloquially call it [[The Dusty Dome]].

#### Religion
The people here practice a number of religions but primarily they are partial to the great Al-Kalim the immortal warrior of the desert.

A small sect worships the nature god [[Obad-Hai]] but the presence of this faith has been steadily dropping over the decades.

#### [[The Catacombs]]
Bellow Scorpions Rest are a network of Catacombs, these lead to various locations under the city and are used primarily to the city's aqueducts and are used for passive cooling of the city.
