A small map shop run by [[Quill]]. It is littered with a number of maps and cartography tools. Some maps depict [[Scorpions Rest]] others are far off lands.

The shop has two rooms. The main one his storefront, the rear his workshop. It seems the two are slowly merging.

### Introduction
As your party pushes open the creaking wooden door, a symphony of tiny bells tinkles overhead, announcing your arrival. The air is heavy with the scent of aged parchment and ink, carrying the essence of exploration and distant lands. The dimly lit space before you is a cluttered haven for cartographers and adventurers alike.

A myriad of maps adorns the walls, their vivid depictions capturing lands both known and unknown. Shelves groan under the weight of rolled parchments, meticulously crafted atlases, and a collection of weathered compasses and drafting tools. The flickering glow of oil lamps casts dancing shadows across the room, illuminating the labyrinthine pathways of maps sprawled across tables and countertops.

In the front of the shop stands the storefront, displaying an assortment of maps showcasing the sprawling expanse of Scorpion's Rest, its details rendered in exquisite detail. However, it's the rear of the shop that draws your attentionâ€”the workshop. A desk cluttered with half-finished maps and tools of the trade sits at the heart of this area, where Quill, the proprietor, is engrossed in the delicate task of adding intricate details to a yet-unfinished cartographic masterpiece.
