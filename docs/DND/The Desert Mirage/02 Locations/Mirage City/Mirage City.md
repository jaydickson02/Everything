#### Legends
Legends tell of a splendid city that appears and disappears with the desert winds. Some claim it's just a mirage, while others insist it's an actual place, home to great treasures and ancient knowledge. Many in [[Scorpions Rest]] whisper about it. Few will even tell their own story if caught at the right moment.

Many have claimed to spot the city, but no one ever see's it twice. Often it is lost travellers who glimpse the city. Many assume they were just desperate to find civilisation.

#### [[The Central Ziggurat]]
Lying at the centre of the city is a large building. This building is the source of the cities limited consciousness. Getting here and awakening the city again will unleash its true power.

#### Changing City
The city is always changing and reshaping itself. Buildings move in the distance and if you turn around you may just find that what was previously a left is now a right. The city changes drastically from day to day, making navigation difficult.

#### Defenses
The city has many defences, on top of its passive ability to disorientate it also is the home of a great metal Minotaur. Further, many traps are present throughout the city, including clockwork soldiers and magitech weapons.

#### Libraries
The great city is home to much knowledge, many great libraries are present throughout the city. They contain tomes of ancient knowledge and a number of artefacts and deeply magical items are stored in their depths.

##### [[The Forbidden Library]]
Even amongst all the knowledge stored in the mirage city, much of it depicting evil as often as good. There is a place deep in the city that hold forbidden knowledge deemed too dangerous for nearly anyone's eyes. This knowledge is hidden within [[The Forbidden Library]].

#### The [[Mechanical Heart]]
It is a magnificent building that moves with the cities changes. The heart houses the relics that allow the city to move and hide as it does. This is also the source of the mirage and most of the cities power, short of the consciousness that resides in [[The Central Ziggurat]].

#### The builders
[[The Architects]] were a set of scholars who banded together to form the city. They sealed themselves within the city walls hidden and sleeping, waiting for someone to awaken them.
