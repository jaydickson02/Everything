#### Residential Knowledge
Scorpions Rest, a city with a rich history, was established 967 years ago in the heart of the Scarab Valley. The inhabitants of this desert city devoutly worship Al-Kalim, who, according to their beliefs, blessed the settlers when they were on the brink of death. Legend has it that Al-Kalim opened the mountains, releasing a bountiful supply of water that allowed the city to flourish in the canyon.

A smaller group worships the god Obad-Hai but their numbers are dwindling. Many residents find their constant preaching to be a bother and occasionally react with aggression or frustration.

The city's social structure is organised into tiers, with higher levels indicating a better socio-economic status. Yasmine, the esteemed elder, presides over the governing body, which comprises eight seats. Permanent seats are granted to members of noble houses, including the influential Khayin, Jude and Leviacus families. The remaining seats are filled at the discretion of the Elder. The Elder themselves serve for life and is chosen from the members of the governing body, by the people, after their passing.

A century ago the lineage of the fourth noble family, the Trintons, died out. They had owned and managed most of the non-agricultural land in the city. The impacts of the end of their line are still being realised today.

To maintain order, the city employs a combined force of government-managed Protector Corps, led by Sheriff Zoya Leyna, and private security known as The Enforcers. This dual system ensures both official and community-based security, contributing to the city's stability.

Scorpions Rest boasts a unique water supply originating from a massive lake atop the canyon. Aqueducts channel water throughout the city, sustaining lush plant life. The Leviacus Noble Family manages and controls the lake and aqueducts, charging a fee for water distribution to homes, businesses and city regions. The city's prosperity extends to vast agricultural plots, primarily owned and operated by the Khayin noble family, ensuring a stable food supply.

The city's wealth is not limited to agriculture; it also extends to resource mining in the surrounding mountains, overseen by the Jude noble family. This mining activity provides essential resources vital for the city's sustenance.

The lower levels of Scorpions Rest are dominated by a criminal group called the Red Sands. While smaller groups may operate independently, many either willingly join the Red Sands or succumb to their dominance. 

Scorpions Rest has entered agreements with the Sandsailers, to deliver water and food to their outposts in exchange for a share of resources and gold. This strategic alliance contributes to the city's economic strength and regional influence.

These outposts are primarily set at the three flat entrances to the Sarab Valley. The largest of which is Serephs Keep guarding the northern entrance.

The nomads and other desert voyages tell tales of horrors hidden in the desert shadows. It is collectively known that to stay in the desert at night is risky in regions less populated.

Despite its isolation, Scorpions Rest welcomes outsiders, as there bravery in journeying this far is respected. The city is a hub for adventurers, explorers, and nomads, adding to its cultural diversity. Many seek to find their fortune in the desert which is full of unexplored ruins, caves and mysteries.
