**Quest Overview: Learning the Art of [[Sandsailer]]**

**Quest Giver: [[Baylorn]]**

**Objective:**
[[Baylorn]], a seasoned [[Sandsailer]], offers to teach the party the art of Sandsailing. To begin their journey, the party must first tame a wind spirit, an essential step in mastering the [[Sandsailer]]. This involves impressing the spirit with a bare board atop a high dune, enticing it to join the adventurers on their desert travels.

**Steps:**

1. **Acquiring the Bare Board:**
   - [[Baylorn]] offers the party the opportunity to purchase a bare [[Sandsailer]] board at a discounted rate. This board will serve as the canvas for impressing the wind spirit.

2. **Journey to the Dunes:**
   - [[Baylorn]] guides the party to a remote expanse of high dunes, the ideal location for the ritual of taming a wind spirit.

3. **Impressing the Wind Spirits:**
   - Each party member must creatively impress the wind spirits, utilising their unique skills and inventiveness to attract and tame a spirit. The more inventive the approach, the greater the chance of success.
   - Using character skills that relate to the interaction with the spirits can reduce the difficulty of taming the spirit.

4. **Successful Taming:**
   - Upon successfully impressing and taming a wind spirit, [[Baylorn]] acknowledges the achievement and provides the party with a set of materials and tools.
   
5. **Personalisation of Sandsailers:**
   - With the provided materials and tools, the party can now personalise their Sandgliders, infusing them with unique designs, symbols, and enchantments to enhance their connection with the wind spirit.

**Key Notes:**
- Creativity in impressing the wind spirits is encouraged and rewarded.
- Utilising character skills can affect the difficulty of taming the spirit.
- [[Baylorn]]'s guidance is pivotal in facilitating the process and providing necessary materials for personalisation.
