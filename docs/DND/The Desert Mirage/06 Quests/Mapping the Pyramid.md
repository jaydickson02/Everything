**Overview:**
The adventurers encounter Cartographer [[Narsilius Quill]], a seasoned explorer in search of the final piece to complete his map. [[Narsilius Quill]] requests the party's assistance in mapping an elusive region within the desert that harbours a pyramid to the West of Scorpions Rest. This pyramid's precise location remains a mystery due to the perilous presence of sand worms and the necessity of navigating the temple's interior to reach its peak.

[[Narsilius Quill]], known by his last name due to his aversion to his first name, Narsilius, proposes utilising a sextant atop the pyramid's summit to triangulate its position by measuring the alignment of three specific stars. Under the night sky, [[Narsilius Quill]] leads the party to the peak of a watchtower, revealing celestial navigation techniques and pointing out the three stars, while regaling them with tales of his family's legacy and his father's obsession with the enigmatic [[Mirage City]]. As night turns to dawn, [[Narsilius Quill]] departs, leaving a farewell message as the adventurers awaken to continue their quest.
