Quest Giver: [[Zoya Leyna]]

[[Zoya Leyna]] requests that the party help handle the bandits who have made camp just south of [[scorpions rest]]. They regularly mug people and hold up the Sandsailing guild to steal supplies.

If you haven't got this quest before [[Narsilius Quill]] asks the party to go to the pyramid the party will run into the bandits on the way and they will attempt to rob the party.
