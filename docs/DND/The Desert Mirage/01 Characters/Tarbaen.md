Tarbaen is a disgraced priest. He pretends to be a protector of innocent children in the lower levels, but in reality, he's working for the nefarious group known as "[[The Red Sands]]." Tarbaen identifies valuable children and passes information about them to [[The Red Sands]]. The group then harms one of the children's family members, and Tarbaen manipulates them into joining The Red Sands under the guise of acquiring the necessary materials to heal their injured relative.
