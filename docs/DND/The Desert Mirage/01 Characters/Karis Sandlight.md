She lives in a underground sandstone house and can be seen observing the stars without fail every night from dusk to dawn. A small amount of light emanates from the candle she brings with her.

She will explain how the lore keeper is an unpredictable constellation. She will explain that it drifts as you walk through the desert seeming to move. The constellation depicts a humanoid figure of a woman that ordinarily stands with her hands close to her hips. Karis will explain that she has travelled the desert seeking to unlock its mystery's and has discovered as you move towards this point in the desert the figure slowly raises her arms. Moving away from this point in any direction causes her arms to begin lowering.

This constellation points towards the [[Mirage City]], this city can be seen if you summit the hill nearby ([[The Parched Peak]]) and stare in the direction the figure is pointing. It must be midnight to see the city.
