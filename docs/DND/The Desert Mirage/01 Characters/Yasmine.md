She hold much sway over [[Scorpions Rest]] as a loved political figure and she uses it compassionately to help her people. She has a rivalry with [[Leora Khayin]] as [[Leora Khayin]] has long since dismissed Yasmine's methods as soft and ineffective. Blaming her for the coming drought and decline of the city. 

Regardless of this Yasmine is still kind and gentle towards Leora, she does not react to her attempts to rile her up.
