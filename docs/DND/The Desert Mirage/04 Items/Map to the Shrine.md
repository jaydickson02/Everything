In your possession is a old ancient map. You uncovered this map on your travels and believe that it may have once depicted the location of some form of ancient relic.

When given  to [[Narsilius Quill]] in [[Scorpions Rest]] and after completing his quest: [[Mapping the Pyramid]]. He will study the map and overlay it over his map of [[The Catacombs]]. Sure enough the maps line up nearly perfectly. Except for a single tunnel leading off from it.

If you head to this point you will find a secret path that opens to reveal the way to [[The Shrine]].

In a forgotten corner of the old, tattered map, the name "Scorpion's Rest" is scribed in delicate script. The map provides sparse detail, its corners worn thin, yet a cryptic limerick in the opposite corner draws the eye:

"Beyond where the arid winds do jest,

Lies the town of the Scorpion's Rest, 

Where shadows hold sway,  

Underneath the light of day,  

Find the Eye in the desert's chest. "
