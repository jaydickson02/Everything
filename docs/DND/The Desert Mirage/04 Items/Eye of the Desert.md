This relic buried beneath Scorpions Rest shortly after it was founded. Its power had allowed Scorpions Rest to flourish when compared with the surrounding settlements. 

It was given to the [[Settlers of Scorpions Rest]] by [[The Architects]] in the Mirage City. The Eye provides abundant water and infuses the land with arcane energy strong enough to cancel out the negative effects of [[The Thirst]].

The Eye has long since been losing its power, as it stands it is deployed in a [[The Shrine]]. This has allowed it to manifest water at the top of the canyon, which flows through the city and the catacombs. If its power fails completely the water will dry up and the city will surely die.

It must be returned to the [[Mirage City]] to be revitalised.

#### Description
It looks like a gold oval tablet with a sapphire sphere in the center. It resembles an eyeball. There are markings on the tablet that are written in a very old language.

#### The Writing
The markings say the following when transcribed and translated:

"Beyond the stars and endless night,

A tale of city lost from sight,

The Lawkeeper's gaze, a guiding spark,

Points the way to shadows dark.

At midnight's hour, on dunes it lies,

Where thirsting sands meet starry skies,

[[The Parched Peak]] stands, a timeless mound,

In secrets veiled, it can be found.

From ancient hands, this tablet's lore,

Reveals a city, gone before,

A riddle wrapped in mystic art,

Awaiting those with noble heart.

The winds may whisper, softly call,

To seekers brave, to one and all,

Follow the path that's etched in rhyme,

Unlock the city lost in time.

Through trials faced, by fate's decree,

The city's secrets you may see,

Unveil the mirage, break the spell,

And in its glory, you shall dwell.

So take this tablet, keep it near,

And let the Lawkeeper's stars appear,

For in the desert's heart you'll seek,

The hidden city, old and sleek."
