- Giant Desert Turtle with a city on its back. It wonders the desert. Eats like a whale, sticking its head into the sand.
- Some form of quick travel through the desert provided you are capable of doing it
	- Think Dune sandworms
- The Ancient Civilization all died out somehow.
	- Perhaps as they were preserving knowledge and they unleashed a Elithid Tadpole by mistake.
	- Not precisely how that works but think about it




Custom Feature: Channeling Corruption

The illithid tadpole that lives in Thalia’s brain will, without intervention, eventually manifest and transform her into a Mind Flayer. Normally, this process takes three days, but the protective blessing of Seldarine, goddess of the moon, has been halting the process. However, in a dire situation. 

Thalia can willingly tap into the psionic wellspring that lives within her. While during so, the cost of casting via spell-points is reduced to zero for the next minute. However, this permanently advances her corruption. 

Every time she uses this effect, the DM rolls 1d8 and keeps track of the result. Thalia does not know the result of this roll. Once her total hits 21, Thalia loses the battle, and transforms into an Ultrathid before the next dawn.
