Those following [[Obad-Hai]] have long since been withering away. The first peoples of the Scarab Valley were devout worshippers of him. They, however incurred his wrath and so the region was cursed with [[The Thirst]]. There was a group that repented and have sought to regain the favour of [[Obad-Hai]]. 

That group although strong at first began to dwindle over the centuries. The lore has been passed down through the church over the centuries. Now only a small temple remains in [[Scorpions Rest]] that continues to have faith in [[Obad-Hai]] and work to reverse the damage done by their ancestors.

These priests are seen as irritating preachers by most at [[Scorpions Rest]] and are treated with indifference and occasionally aggression by them. 

Their views on [[The Thirst]] are dismissed and those in [[Scorpions Rest]] have historically not had to suffer the effects due to the influence of the [[Eye of the Desert]].

They seek to enter the old city home to their ancestors that they believe may still hold vestiges of [[The Garden]] a site blessed by [[Obad-Hai]]. Many crusades have sought it but all have failed to uncover anything of significance with many incurring significant fatalities in the process.
