The Organisation is a far reaching society. It has pull in many cities around the world. This organisation is a thousand years old founded by [[The Fallen Kingdoms]] with the exclusive purpose of taking back control of the Mirage City.

They have grown their operation over the years and operate a number of branches in secret. Many of their members are high ranking influential individuals. 

They leverage their power to blackmail those they can not recruit. 

Their most visible branch are the enforcers and the auditors. As these groups most need to interface with the public. 

##### Branches
- Acquisitions ^561d7f
	- Manage the acquisition of magical objects and other significant relics.
	- Headed by [[Malaya]]
- Enforcement - 'The Enforcers'
	- A private and decentralised army often outsourced in parts around the world. People pay a small fee to have them protect their shops and homes.
	- This division is often the only experience people have with The Organisation. It's so prevalent that many believe its all The Organisation is and refer to them by a psudo-alias: "The Enforcers".
- Auditing
	- The tax division. They ensure everyone is paying what they owe. They also keep an eye on members and their progress. Generally in secret.

	- Give and provide information on a variety of topics. Including the use, activation and value of magical items.
- Finance
	- Manage the organisations funding and oversee the buying and selling of assets.
- Discernment

Re: The Party
The Organisation has recently discovered a converted item. One of the ancient maps known by them to be a key to regaining access to the Mirage City. The Organisation will follow their progress carefully once its clear they are progressing down the path.

Re: [[Bren (CJ)]]
As one of the fastest rising scholars in the order and with a propensity for gathering information fast. They took a risk on Bren giving him a task that seemed fairly standard but was in fact a ploy to rediscover the Mirage City and crack the code.

Re: [[Scorpions Rest]]
Leora operates as The Organisations authority in [[Scorpions Rest]]. She is a secret operative. She is not just interested in finding the Mirage City though. She seeks power in Scorpions Rest and plans to use [[The Organisation]] to get it. 

The people only know of The Organisation as 'The Enforcers' which is the people facing aspect of their business. The Organisation as a whole is a well kept secret or at least people who suspect know enough to keep quiet. For their own sakes.
