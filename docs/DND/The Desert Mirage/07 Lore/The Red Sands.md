These are the largest group of thugs in the city of [[Scorpions Rest]]. They prowl the lower levels using it as a recruitment ground to find children of value. They steal, blackmail and kill to get what they want.

They are an extension of The Organisation, and work to create the discourse needed to drive desperate children towards them.

[[Tarbaen]] is secretly a member and works with them to acquire children.
