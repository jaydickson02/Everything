In the unforgiving terrain surrounding [[Scorpions Rest]], a group of ten intrepid explorers found themselves ensnared by the merciless grasp of the desert's hostility. Isolated and slowly yielding to the harsh elements, their fate appeared bleak until an extraordinary occurrence transpired. The nascent [[Mirage City]], having emerged just a century prior, witnessed their plight and extended an empathetic hand to these weary travelers.

Moved by compassion, the inhabitants of the [[Mirage City]] presented the explorers with an extraordinary artifact known as the [[Eye of the Desert]]â€”an artifact imbued with the power to conjure seemingly limitless water. In gratitude and awe, the settlers accepted the relic and vowed their eternal gratitude and loyalty to the benevolent denizens of the [[Mirage City]].

Harnessing the remarkable capabilities of the [[Eye of the Desert]], the settlers activated its ancient power, transforming the arid canyon adjacent to their enclave into a vibrant river, breathing life into the parched land. With the newfound abundance of water, they commenced cultivating the soil, sowing seeds, and nurturing their burgeoning community. Their population burgeoned as word of the thriving oasis reached the ears of weary travelers, drawing them inexorably toward the blossoming city.

As generations passed, the city and its environs flourished, evolving into a bastion of prosperity and sustenance. Yet, to safeguard the sanctity of the relic and honor the enduring bond with the [[Mirage City]], the Eye was reverently concealed beneath the city's foundations, entombed within the labyrinthine catacombs, its legacy woven into the very fabric of [[Scorpions Rest]].
