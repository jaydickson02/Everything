A demonic presence riddles the desert at night. Demons made of shadow stalk the unpopulated parts of the desert looking for prey.

These demons are the result of fallen demons failing to properly regain their corporal bodies upon death.

These particular demons are under the control of a dark sorcerer (TBD)
