A wealthy scholar, and political rival to [[Yasmine]], she has a polite, sophisticated exterior that masks her ruthless and greedy nature. She supports the party initially, but her true intentions are to seize the [[Mirage City]] for her personal gain.

She hopes to become ruler of both the [[Mirage City]] and [[Scorpions Rest]]. She intends to keep the [[Eye of the Desert]] from the city and as such can cripple them, forcing them to rely on her and her new city.

For this reason she wields her significant forces in an attempt to take over the [[Mirage City]] once its path has been uncovered. She will kill [[Yasmine]] once the party has left, leaving [[Scorpions Rest]] in chaos and creating the power void needed for her to rise.
