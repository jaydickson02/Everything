The inhabitants of this desert city devoutly worship Al-Kalim, who, according to their beliefs, blessed the settlers when they were on the brink of death. Legend has it that Al-Kalim opened the mountains, releasing a bountiful supply of water that allowed the city to flourish in the canyon.</p> <p>A smaller group worships the god Obad-Hai but their numbers are dwindling. Many residents find their constant preaching to be a bother and occasionally react with aggression or frustration.</p> <p>The city's social structure is organised into tiers, with higher levels indicating a better socio-economic status. Yasmine, the esteemed elder, presides over the governing body, which comprises eight seats.

The Elder themselves serve for life and is chosen from the members of the governing body, by the people, after their passing.</p> <p>A century ago the lineage of the fourth noble family, the Trintons, died out. They had owned and managed most of the non-agricultural land in the city. The impacts of the end of their line are still being realised today.</p> <p>To maintain order, the city employs a combined force of government-managed Protector Corps, led by Sheriff Zoya Leyna, and private security known as The Enforcers. This dual system ensures both official and community-based security, contributing to the city's stability.</p> <p>Scorpions Rest boasts a unique water supply originating from a massive lake atop the canyon. Aqueducts channel water throughout the city, sustaining lush plant life. The Leviacus Noble Family manages and controls the lake and aqueducts, charging a fee for water distribution to homes, businesses and city regions. The city's prosperity extends to vast agricultural plots, primarily owned and operated by the Khayin noble family, ensuring a stable food supply.</p> <p>The city's wealth is not limited to agriculture; it also extends to resource mining in the surrounding mountains, overseen by the Jude noble family. This mining activity provides essential resources vital for the city's sustenance.</p> <p>The lower levels of Scorpions Rest are dominated by a criminal group called the Red Sands. While smaller groups may operate independently, many either willingly join the Red Sands or succumb to their dominance. </p> <p>Scorpions Rest has entered agreements with the Sandsailers, to deliver water and food to their outposts in exchange for a share of resources and gold. This strategic alliance contributes to the city's economic strength and regional influence.</p> <p>These outposts are primarily set at the three flat entrances to the Sarab Valley. The largest of which is Serephs Keep guarding the northern entrance.</p> <p>The nomads and other desert voyages tell tales of horrors hidden in the desert shadows. It is collectively known that to stay in the desert at night is risky in regions less populated.</p> <p>Despite its isolation, Scorpions Rest welcomes outsiders, as there bravery in journeying this far is respected. The city is a hub for adventurers, explorers, and nomads, adding to its cultural diversity. Many seek to find their fortune in the desert which is full of unexplored ruins, caves and mysteries.</p>"},{"location":"DND/The%20Desert%20Mirage/Common%20Information/#traveller-knowledge","title":"Traveller Knowledge","text":"<p>Scorpions Rest, a city with a rich history, was established 967 years ago in the heart of the Scarab Valley.

Crafters invest time and skill into these gliders, infusing them with intricate designs and protective enchantments that preserve both structure and spirit.</p> <p>Tamed Wind Spirits: Integral to the Sandsailer's function is the encapsulation of a wind spirit, an elemental entity harnessed tamed by the rider. These spirits, tethered to the glider, infuse it with the essence of wind, granting the board a semblance of sentient \"personality\" and a unique connection to its rider. The spirit's energy not only propels the Sandsailer but also imbues it with a touch of ethereal aura, enhancing its responsiveness to the winds and the user's commands.</p> <p>Usage: Once aboard the Sandsailer, the rider harnesses the wind spirit's power by manipulating the sail. With expertise and finesse, they navigate the undulating dunes, catching gusts of wind to glide across the sands akin to surfing on waves. The Sandsailer's symbiotic relationship with the wind spirit allows for an intuitive connection between rider and board, enabling breathtaking manoeuvres and swift travel through the desert terrain.</p> <p>Personalisation and 'Personality': Each Sandsailer is a reflection of its owner's personality, adorned with unique patterns, symbols, and embellishments. The bond between the wind spirit and its glider creates a distinctive character, manifesting as quirks in behaviour or subtle nuances in how the glider responds to its rider's commands. Some may exude an adventurous spirit, while others could display a cautious nature, influencing their performance and behaviour.</p> <p>Cultural Significance: Highly cherished among desert dwellers, Sandsailers hold cultural significance beyond their practical use. They symbolise freedom, skill, and the harmony between mortal and elemental forces. Riders often form profound connections with their gliders, treating them as companions on their desert journeys and honouring the wind spirits that reside within.</p> <p>In the vast desert landscapes, the Sandsailer represents both a utilitarian vehicle and a mystical embodiment of the desert's essence, fostering a deep connection between rider, wind, and the shifting sands they traverse.</p>"},{"location":"DND/The%20Desert%20Mirage/05%20Homebrew%20Rules/Desert%20Specific%20Rules/","title":"Desert Specific Rules","text":""},{"location":"DND/The%20Desert%20Mirage/06%20Quests/Catching%20the%20Vibrant%20Spirit/","title":"Catching the Vibrant Spirit","text":"<ul> <li>Baylorn Windswept wants you to help him catch a particularly energetic wind spirt that often wreaks havoc on the camp.

It also prevents the need for modifications.</p> </li> <li> <p>Manage and Store Satellite Data: This involves processing data and outputting a control maneuver that optimizes the trajectory of each satellite. To achieve this, you need to use machine learning algorithms. These algorithms should be trained to prioritize actions that minimize fuel usage, increase useful mission time, maintain power levels, decrease chances of catastrophic failure, and optimize overall efficiency. The algorithms should also account for the benefit of individual satellites as well as the overall collective satellite system.</p> </li> <li> <p>Flexibility: The system should be flexible and allow for independent configuration of priorities for each satellite. For example, some satellites might prioritize minimizing fuel usage, while others might prioritize time over a particular area or maintaining a particular distance from other satellites.</p> </li> <li> <p>Account for Orbital Hazards: The system should account for not only connected satellites but also space junk and other orbital hazards. Ground tracking systems can provide up-to-date information on these hazards, which can be used to adjust satellite trajectories as needed. Use an Open Standard: Use an open standard that can be incrementally improved and built upon. This will allow the system to adapt to changing needs over time.</p> </li> <li> <p>To implement this system, you will need to develop machine learning algorithms that can account for the specific priorities and requirements of your satellite network. These algorithms should be supported by other physics software that performs pre and post-work on the data to account for the actual physics or maneuver calculations.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Overall, building a system for managing satellite trajectories requires careful consideration of communication, data management, machine learning algorithms, and system flexibility.
